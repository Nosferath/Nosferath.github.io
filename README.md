Hi, I'm Claudio! I am a full stack developer, so I will (eventually) set up a personal GitHub Page in here. I've got too much work right now ðŸ˜….

For now though, it will probably be a bit empty. I will be updating it in the next weeks as I learn more and more about how to set up a proper website.
